    "The notebook uses [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) and [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to deploy all necessary Azure resources. Both tools are available on Windows, macOS and Linux environments. It also uses [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) to run the C# code that interacts with Azure AI Document Intelligence and Azure OpenAI Service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this notebook will deploy the following resources in your Azure subscription:\n",

    "**Note**: Any GPT-3.5 Turbo model can be used with this sample. To provide a single region deployment for both the Azure AI Document Intelligence and Azure OpenAI Service, the GPT-3.5 Turbo 16K model is used in this sample in the East US region. For more information on the available GPT models, see the [Azure OpenAI Service documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#gpt-35).
